> Fun little play around project with CSS positioning, shapes and animations.

## Goals
* Learn about CSS animations and how to create complex shapes.

## Results
* The initial goal was to just create a cloud in CSS. I thought I'd carry on and create a few more complex shapes and animations.

## Steps

### Create a cloud!

> I started off by researching how to create a complex shape such as a cloud. I looked at ways to do this through SVGs but then came across a very simple way to do this via 3 rectangles with full border radius: a long rectangle as the base, then two more rectangles (squares) relatively positioned to the base rectangle. The squares turn to circles and the base has semi-circles on each end.
