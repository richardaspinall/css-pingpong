> Fun little play around project with CSS positioning, shapes and animations.

## Goals
* Learn about CSS animations and how to create complex shapes.

## Results
* The initial goal was to just create a cloud in CSS. I thought I'd carry on and create a few more complex shapes and animations.

## Steps

### Create a cloud!

I started off by researching how to create a complex shape such as a cloud. I looked at ways to do this through SVGs but then came across a very simple way to do this via 3 rectangles with full border radius: a long rectangle as the base, then two more rectangles (squares) relatively positioned to the base rectangle using pseudo selectors. The squares turn to circles and the base has fully rounded ends.

### Creating the rackets

I used the same method as creating a cloud to create the rackets. Then rotated them to face off. Exact positioning was made a lot easier by putting a red box around the bat.
